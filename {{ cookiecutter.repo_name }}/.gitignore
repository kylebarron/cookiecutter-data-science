# PDF versions of figures
# I export all images as SVGs, then use the Pandoc-svg.py filter to convert them
# to PDFs. But I don't need all of the images in Git as both formats
#
# This should match all of:
# out/fig/image.pdf
# out/fig/more/directories/image.pdf
# out/20/fig/image.pdf
# out/20/fig/more/directories/image.pdf
out/**/fig/**/*.pdf
